# Muzzle 
 This is a move block game. There are three place will random generate different combination of majhong cards. you could drag cards from there and put on a 9X9 board. While the board has a row, a column or a 3x3, the cards would disappear and you get score. If the majhong cards are same type (circle, bamboo, character) you would get extra score. If there is gragon card you would also get extre score. When all there combination of majhong cards cannot fit into the board. The game is over.
 
 Difficulty : steps < 10 Only card number of combination <= 3 will be generated. 10 < steps < 50 : All kinds of card combination would be generated. steps > 50 : The chance that generated 3 or more would increase. steps > 100: only card number of combination >= 3 will be generated
# To do (plan)
sound effect when place cards into the board and when game ends. Animation when place cards into the board. 
I am bad at art, more beautiful UI and end game page are needed

# TBD
