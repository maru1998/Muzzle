# Muzzle 
 This is a move block game. There are three place will random generate different combination of majhong cards. you could drag cards from there and put on a 9X9 board. While the board has a row, a column or a 3x3, the cards would disappear and you get score. If the majhong cards are same type (circle, bamboo, character) you would get extra score. If there is gragon card you would also get extre score. When all there combination of majhong cards cannot fit into the board. The game is over.
